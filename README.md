RF CTF Fox code

These are currently targeted to and used on the M5Stack Atom Lite

I would like to extend these to support M5Stack AtomS3 Lite as well as other esp32 boards but the platformio syntax for that is more than I know right now.  PR's for additional hardware support will be accepted if they look sane.

TODO: use m5unified or don't use m5* at all to be more hardware agnostic
TODO: use fastled directly to be more hardware agnostic
